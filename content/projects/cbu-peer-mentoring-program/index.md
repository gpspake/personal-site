George volunteered as a mentor to a Junior Computer Science Major at Christian
Brothers University.  
  
The Peer Mentoring Program is designed as an additional resource for students
who want to build a strong relationship with their peers while learning new
skills and gaining experience that will lead to success academically and
socially.
