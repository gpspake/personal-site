Grunterie is a WordPress theme built with Zurb Foundation. When the Reverie
theme that Grunterie is based on was no longer supported, George forked the
project and maintained it as an open source project for some time. While
Grunterie is no longer maintained, it was the basis for the UTHSC WordPress
theme that is still live on the UTHSC news site.
