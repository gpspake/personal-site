Here are the slides for the talk I gave at [Techcamp
Memphis](http://www.techcampmemphis.org/sessions/beyond-seo-what-your-web-
developer-wants-you-to-know-about-web-content/) on November 5, 2016

_Abstract:  I build websites for a diverse set of clients and the greatest
challenge I consistently face is not code related; it’s educating clients
about web content. Many people want to build a website for themselves or their
business but are unaware of the responsibility they’re taking on and the
differences between the web and other more familiar mediums. In this talk, I
hope to address some misconceptions I see going in to a lot of projects and
talk about what non-coders, marketing professionals, site owners, and laymen
should know about the web to work and communicate more effectively with web
developers._
