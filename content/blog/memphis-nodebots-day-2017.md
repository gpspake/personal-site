Today marked the first annual Memphis NodeBots event.

"NodeBots Day is world wide event where people learn how to control the
physical world with JavaScript." - [nodebots.io](http://nodebots.io/#about)

NodeBots day was a sold out event where attendees built a robot from scratch
and programmed it with javascript. This event has been several years in the
making and couldn't have gone better. Everyone's robot worked and there were
no wifi issues which can make or break an event like this.

Once everyone's robots were assembled and working, a soccer tournament was
held and my cousin dominated with seven goals!

NodeBots day was held in the Fedex Institute of Technology on the same day as
a [codecrew](https://www.code-crew.org/) hackathon so some of Memphis's best
and brightest kids got to come by and cheer on during the soccer match. It was
really exciting to see such a diverse group of tech enthusiasts and innovators
in one place.
