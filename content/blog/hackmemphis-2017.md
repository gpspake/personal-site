This past weekend, the memphis tech community got together at the Fedex
Institute of technology on the University of Memphis campus for the fifth
annual [HackMemphis](http://www.hackmemphis.com/) event. HackMemphis,
organized by the [Memphis Technology
Foundation](http://www.memphistechnology.org/), is a different kind of
hackathon where there's no pressure and teams are free to work on whatever
they want. Some of the city's best developers, designers, makers, and tech
leaders get together for a weekend to hang out and work on fun projects.

Projects included a virtual reality cycling game, a working R2-D2 robot made
from a plastic jar with 3d printed parts and a camera, a wifi enabled system
for brewing beer, and a flappy bird game built with the Go programming
language. My favorite part of HackMemphis, aside from the chance to spend time
with memtech friends, is helping new developers with their projects,
introducing them to the other seasoned developers in the room, encouraging
them to get involved in more memtech events, and inspiring them to continue to
pursue programming as a passion.

This year stood out because of a large AutoZone presence. AutoZone,
headquartered in Memphis, was the event's second ever diamond sponsor and
showed out in force. Around ten AutoZone employees participated in the event
and AutoZone's CEO, CIO, and a number of other IT decision makers from the
company were present at the event throughout the weekend to see the action.
This represents the most significant engagement by a local IT industry leader
with the memtech community that I can recall and signals that this collective
of practicing professionals and enthusiasts is getting the attention of
Memphis employers.
