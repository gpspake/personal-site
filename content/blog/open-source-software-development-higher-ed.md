Talk: I'll be giving a talk about the role of open source development in
higher ed institutions at the upcoming [Tennessee Higher Education Information
Technology Symposium](http://www2.tntech.edu/itsymposium/default.asp) in
Chattanooga Tennessee. The talk will focus on the experience I had with the
[UTHSC-WPCAS](http://https://wordpress.org/plugins/uthsc-wpcas/) plugin
developed for UTHSC and encourage Higher-Ed tech professionals to consider
open sourcing their work and to consider open source options when making IT
decisions.

You can read the
[abstract](http://www2.tntech.edu/itsymposium/abstracts.asp#26) on the THEITS
website and view the [UTHSC-WPCAS source code on
GitHub](http://https://github.com/uthsc/UTHSC-WPCAS)
