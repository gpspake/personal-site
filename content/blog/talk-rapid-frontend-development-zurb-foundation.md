Here are the slides for my talk at the [Memphis Web Workers User
Group](http://memphiswebworkers.com/) on October 10, 2014.

**Abstract:**

> Zurb Foundation is the self-proclaimed "advanced responsive front-end
> framework in the world." I've worked with Foundation on a number of projects
> over the past couple of years and it's an awesome tool. In this talk, I'll
> briefly go over what a front-end framework is and why you might want to use
> one; I'll compare Foundation and Bootstrap, the other most popular front-end
> framework; I'll talk about setting up a Foundation project with Grunt and
> SASS; and finally I'll give a quick demo of some of foundation's components
> in action. If you want to read up on Foundation before the meetup, check out
> the docs at
> [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)/
