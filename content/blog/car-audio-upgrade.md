I've had aftermarket audio in my car for close to a decade so I guess it's
safe to say I'm an enthusiast. It all started when I purchased two 12″ subs,
an amp, and a box from a friend. Since then, I've replaced some equipment,
switched cars, fixed some wiring, and I became pretty familiar with how it all
worked and how to troubleshoot problems. However, because I never did a full
DIY install or bought matching parts, I've never really had full confidence
that my system was as well put together as it could be or that I fully
understood it.

Recently, I decided that it was time to spec out an entire system with the
help of an expert and install the whole thing at once on my own. So, I called
[Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com) and they put together a full system
for my 2001 Nissan Maxima consisting of two new subs, a new sub amp, four new
component speakers, and a component amp. Here's what I ended up with:

  * [Sound Ordnance M75-4](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_777M754/Sound-Ordnance-M75-4.html)
  * [Polk Audio DB 6502](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_107DB6502/Polk-Audio-DB-6502.html)
  * [JBL GTX500](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_109GTX500/JBL-GTX500.html)
  * [Rockford Fosgate Punch P1S4-12](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_575P1S4122/Rockford-Fosgate-Punch-P1S4-12.html)
  * [Polk Audio DB 652](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_107DB652/Polk-Audio-DB-652.html)
  * I used the 2×12 enclosure that I bought from my friend over ten years ago. It's the last remaining piece of my original system.

Here's a link to [buy the same stuff on
Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com/I-rETNc108/I-rXYEc222/cart/EmailCart.aspx?emKey=1942592)

I returned from a five day trip to a giant box full of audio equipment and got
right to work. In all, I spent about a week working on the install a little
bit at a time. My car is basically like a big lego set so I got used to
popping out panels and running cables. While I had everything taken apart, I
was able clean up tons of cables left over from the previous owner's system.

During the installation process, I called
[Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com) multiple times with noob questions
about which wire goes where and which switch to flip, but I always got the
answers I needed. I would recommend [Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com)
to anyone interested in DIY car audio.
