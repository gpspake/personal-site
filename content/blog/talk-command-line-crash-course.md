These are the slides and notes from my Command Line Crash Course talk
presented at DevMemphis on March 3, 2020
<!--more--> 

This was the first DevMemphis meetup that was streamed live and recorded but,
unfortunately, because of some issues with the recording, the audio was
unusable.

> between humans and computers. The terminals and shells through which we
