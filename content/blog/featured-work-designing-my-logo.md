I've always been fascinated by logo design. A good logo can carry a brand for
a very long time; it's not something that's meant to change frequently so the
opportunity to design one doesn't come along very often. There are a lot of
things to keep in mind when designing a logo. Obviously it needs to be eye
catching and iconic but the designer also needs to consider how the logo will
fit into various compositions, how it will be used across mediums and how it
will look in monochrome.

When I set out to redesign my logo I struggled to balance all of these
considerations. I was happy with my previous logo but I had trouble using it
in certain places because of its shape. There were also some unnecessary
elements left over from an original design that managed to make it in to the
final. When I made the decision to redesign my site, I figured it would be a
good time to start from scratch.

I started by sketching out some ideas. I wanted the logo to include my
initials but I needed to design it in such a way that it would fit inside a
square or a circle. I liked the idea of using a hexagon. After coming up with
an initial design on paper, I transitioned in to Illustrator to polish it up
with some good ol' geometry. I've found that sometimes, when I have a hard
time finalizing design decisions, it's easier to let geometry do the work.

The finalized logo is essentially just comprised of three hexagons with a few
shapes subtracted to form my initials and a spiral shape-the spiral shape was
actually an unintended bonus. My hope is that the logo is recognizable but
that the initials are not immediately apparent. It's always cool when some
blatantly obvious part of a logo comes as a surprise when revealed even though
it has been there all along - see the arrow in the FedEX logo or the A to Z in
the amazon logo. My friend told me that my logo looks like an 'evil
corporation's logo.' I guess I'm OK with that.
