I've been working on a major redesign at work and even with the help of
Foundation doing a lot of the heavy lifting, there's still a lot of
challenging and often hacky fixes that go in to custom frontend development.

accessibility, and properly structured markup, a lot of the tricky stuff will
fall in to place.
