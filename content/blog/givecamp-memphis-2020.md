Last weekend I participated in [GiveCamp
Memphis](https://www.givecampmemphis.org/), a weekend long event where tech
professionals come together to help Memphis non profits solve problems. This
year, the event coincided with the AIGA Memphis Chapter's [Design for
Good](https://www.aiga.org/design-for-good) event. This is the fourth year

Iâ€™ve participated in GiveCamp and, with 20 non profits; 30+ projects
completed; over 125 volunteers; and over 3,000 service hours provided, it was
the largest GiveCamp yet.

As a member of the project management committee, I worked with other
volunteers and non-profit representatives prior to GiveCamp to ensure that
everyone was prepared. During the event, I was responsible for ensuring that
four teams had everything they needed in addition to helping out with the
actual projects.

As usual, GiveCamp felt more like fun than work. I spent over 30 hours on-site
during the weekend. One of my favorite parts of the event was recreating this
photo taken at GiveCamp 2018 with (most of) the same people.
