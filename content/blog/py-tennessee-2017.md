This past weekend, I rode to Nashville with some friends from the [Memphis
user group community](http://www.memphistechnology.org/) to attend [Py
Tennessee 2017](https://www.pytennessee.org/). This was my first year
attending the conference and I'd hardly call myself a Python developer but I
had a great time, learned a lot from the talks, and met some really cool
people from all over the country. The Python crowd is known for being
welcoming and, as a user-group organizer and tech community evangelist, I
enjoyed all of the discussions around community and mentorship. The food at
the conference was awesome and there was an endless supply of candy, junk
food, and soft drinks. I'm looking forward to attending again next year.
