## What’s a Technical User Group?

Memphis is home to a thriving tech scene and a welcoming community of
technical experts, enthusiasts, and beginners who you can find on any given
day of the week at one of the many active [technical
meetups](https://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/) in town.
<!--more-->
User group meetings feature conference quality content delivered by members of
the Memphis technical community, open discussion, and pizza. All of this is
totally free and open to anyone who wants to attend.

## What’s DevMemphis?

Most of the Memphis technical user groups, like [MemPy](http://www.mempy.org/)
and [Memphis PHP](https://www.meetup.com/Memphis-PHP-Meetup/), focus on a
specific topic. The [Memphis Web Workers](http://memphiswebworkers.com/) user
group  has been very successful as a general-purpose user group for topics
related to web design, development, and content creation. DevMemphis aims to
apply that same general-purpose approach to topics that appeal to a broad
audience of software developers but that might not be the right fit for Web
Workers or other user groups. This will provide a platform for content related
to new or niche programming languages, design patterns, developer experience,
and more.

## How Do I Attend?

DevMemphis will meet on the first Tuesday of every month at 6pm in Rm. 225
Fedex Institute of Technology on the University of Memphis.

365 Innovation Dr,  
Rm 225  
Memphis, TN 38152
