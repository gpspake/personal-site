Here are the slides for my talk at [Tech Camp
Memphis](http://techcampmemphis.com/) 2014.

**Abstract:**

> Over just a few years, the rise of mobile technology has dramatically
> changed the way people interact with the web. As a result, the web community
> has adapted quickly to meet new challenges and ensure that websites look
> good and function properly on a seemingly endless number of devices. Not to
> fear though, the role of web designers is more important and exciting than
> ever. In this talk, I’ll begin with a brief history of mobile web access and
> what it means for designers; I’ll introduce the concepts behind Responsive
> Web Design and Mobile First Web Design and finally I’ll talk about some of
> the great tools and resources available to make life easier for web
> designers working in an changing field.
