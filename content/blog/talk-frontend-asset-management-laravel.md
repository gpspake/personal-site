Summary:  
_Laravel ships with elixir, a gulp plugin with a clean syntax for building out
your frontend assets. While elixir is great in a lot of cases, it comes with
some limitations on projects with more complex frontend build requirements. I
'll talk about why elixir is great, why it didn't work for us, and how we
integrated our frontend framework in Laravel with some gulp magic._
