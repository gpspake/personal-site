I wanted to to light up some 1/6 scale figures easily without having to flip
switches or replace dead batteries.

The [Soap
Reactor](http://www.soapstudio.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=477&product_id=644)
is the go-to solution for this but it's expensive and hard to buy so I decided
to go the DIY route with a little help from a [Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hottoys.collectors/permalink/2330382036984260/),
some coworkers, and friends.

## Pros and Cons

Before we get started, let's look at the tradeoffs for each of our power
supply options.

Batteries|  
---|---  
Pros| wireless, easy setup, included out of the box  
Cons| tedious to turn on/off, risky to leave in (corrosion), need to be
replaced eventually  
Soap Reactor |   
---|---  
Pros| easy to turn on/off, nice looking battery cells, easy setup, no battery
replacement required  
Cons| wires, hard to buy in US (I honestly couldn't figure out how to buy),
expensive base unit, requires purchase of additional battery  
cell replacements, limited number of terminals so additional base unit
required to power more cells  
DIY power supply |   
---|---  
Pros | easy to turn on/off, no battery replacement required, materials available online, cheaper than soap reactor, essentially unlimited cells, more flexibility with cable management, fun project (if you're in to that kind of thing)  
Cons| wires, More difficult to set up, more expensive than batteries

## Building Your Own Power Source

Here's What I'll be Powering:

**Figure**| **Battery Count**| **Description**  
---|---|---  
War Machine| 4 x 3 x 1.5v | Head, Hands x 2, Chest  
Iron Man Mark34| 4 x 3 x 1.5v| Head, Hands x 2, Chest  
Hulkbuster + Jackhammer Arm| 8 x 3 x 1.5v| Head, Arm, Jack Hammer Arm x 2
Chest, Legs x 2  
Other stuff in the future| ???| ???  
  
I needed to power 16 cells (or 48 batteries total). Each terminal holds 3 x
1.5v batteries (for a total of 4.5v). They vary in size of batteries but I
don't really care about that because they're all the same voltage and I'm
making my own replacements that I can cut to size.

### The Power Supply

![](https://georgespake.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/adapter.png)Adjustable
adapter to barrel connector to electrical cable to JST connector

I'll start with an adjustable adapter set to 3v (this one came with a led
barrel connector) - It probably wouldn't hurt to set it at 4.5v but I'm
staying slightly under powered just to stay under the full rating. Batteries
aren't going to output a full 4.5v either. Ideally I'd set it at 4v but that's
not an option on this adapter and I didn't have much luck finding a 4v
adapter.  
I ended up purchasing a 3.3v adapter and a separate led barrel connector so
I'll have 2 in case I want to take any of the figures out of the display and
power them separately; this has been really useful for reposing and
maintenance.

From the barrel connector, I run electrical wire to a JST connector. I put JST
connectors at every link so I can plug/unplug different parts quickly and
easily and I don't have to twist wires or solder anything.  
JST connectors require a special crimp tool that cost me $30 so if you opt out
of the connectors and the tool for another connection method, you can save
around $40

### Splitting Connections

I used terminal blocks when I need to split one wire out to 3 or 4 - with the
exception of the Hulk-Buster where I needed 8; this would get ugly with a
terminal block so I got a strip instead.  
I ended up using a terminal block for each of the suits (with 4 connections)
and one in the display cases to split the wire coming in between the middle
and top shelf. From the terminal blocks/strip I connected a short length of
electrical wire with a JST connector that will connect to the "last mile"

block.png) ![](https://georgespake.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/terminal-

![](https://georgespake.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/terminal-strip.png)

for the connections between the terminal blocks/strip and the battery
replacements, I twisted blue and black wrapping wire using a power drill.  
Just connect one end to a doorknob and the other to a drill and pull the
trigger. I cut the twisted wire in to strips long enough to allow for cable
management. You'll want to hide your wires and tuck them in where you can so
it's not a straight line to from the battery to the terminal.

For the battery packs, strip the end of the wrapping wire and cut off a thin
strip of the conductive tape for positive and negative. Wrap the conductive
tape around the wire in to flat squares, then superglue them to a plug (or
whatever you use) that you've cut to fit in the socket. I always glued
positive (blue) to the bigger end for consistency. You'll want a JST connector
on one end for connecting to the terminal and a battery pack on the other.

## Cable Management

**For the Figure**

I took advantage of any opening I could find to weave the wires through the
figure so they were well hidden. Then I used scraps of the black wrapping wire
to twist around groups of wires to keep them neat before wrapping them in a
1/8 inch sleeve.

Don't worry about the screw on battery covers; most of them won't accommodate
the wire sticking out and they're hidden by outer panels. I ended up with a
bunch in plastic baggies when I was finished

**Display Cable Management**

To hide the terminal blocks, I used a couple of black plastic project boxes. I
drilled a hole in both ends for the wires and used some rubber rings to make
them look clean. Then I carefully crammed everything in and closed them up.

## Turning it all on

What fun is a single power supply if you can't turn it on with the click of a
button? The last step was plugging the power supply in to this wireless remote
control outlet.
