Bali 2013:**Day 1** [Day 2](/blog/bali-2013-day-2/) [Day
3](/blog/bali-2013-day-3/) [Day 4](/blog/bali-2013-day-4/)

After arriving in Bali, we waited around at the airport until some guy brought
our rental car. It was a beat up manual minivan with the steering wheel on the
right side but Ken handled it was his own. As he dashed through the chaotic
sea of minivans and motorcycles, we got a quick glimpse of local life. We
checked in to the Grand Hyatt and spent the first day relaxing and swimming at
the resort. The night ended with a traditional Balinese dance and an
Indonesian buffet.
