Raffles are held occasionally at events around campus. A coworker and I worked
together to build an ID badge driven online raffle for campus events to
replace the antiquated ticket drawing and number calling method used
previously. Instead of getting a ticket at the door, attendees would scan
their ID badges at the door and would automatically be entered in to the
raffle; when it was time to choose a winner, a button would be pressed and a
short roulette animation accompanied by a drumroll and a fanfare would reveal
the winner by name. It gave our web services and application development
groups an opportunity to work together on a fun project and to connect with
the campus.

My portion of the talk covered the web technologies used to choose a winner
and display a visual roulette style raffle on the screen. My coworker
discussed the use of Banner workflows that drove the card reader
functionality. We discussed the value of these sorts of projects both in terms
of the experience and IT's relationship with the campus.
